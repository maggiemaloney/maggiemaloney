<h1> ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @maggiemaloney </h1>

ðŸ’ª I'm all about how we can leverage technology to support changemakers! I have been working at non-profits for years, and I always love finding creative technology solutions to help my organization and those we serve to their work better, faster, and with more fun. 

ðŸŒ± As you can see from my basic - but for me <strong> very exciting </strong> - coding, Iâ€™m currently learning how to code! I am making my way through some basic HTML, CSS and Javascript courses. I am pretty excited to learn about GitHub, play around with what I have learned so far, and see what others are building! 

ðŸ’» You can connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maggiemaloney60/"> LinkedIn
